> **A comprehensive, offline-first productivity suite designed to manage daily habits, academic tasks, finances, and spiritual goals in one unified interface.**

## 📖 Overview

**My Life Tracker** is not just another to-do list. It is a fully functional **Single Page Application (SPA)** built with Python and Streamlit. It solves the problem of app fragmentation by combining essential life management tools into a single, cohesive dashboard. I Created this Web Application based on my own daily activity and priority.

This project demonstrates complex **State Management**, **Data Persistence (JSON)**, and **Dynamic CRUD Operations** without relying on heavy external database services.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 📝 Dynamic Dashboard
* **Daily Routine Tracker:** Auto-resetting checklists for prayers, chores, and self-care.
* **Exercise Logger:** Tracks workout types (Push/Pull/Legs) and completion status.
* **Reading Tracker:** Logs progress for Books and Quran reading.

### 2. 🎓 Academic Management (CRUD)
* **Dynamic Course Creation:** Users can add/remove subjects (Mata Kuliah) on the fly.
* **Task Management:** Add specific tasks/assignments per subject with individual progress tracking.

### 3. 💵 Financial Ledger System
* **Dual Wallet Tracking:** Separate tracking for **Cash (Wallet)** and **Bank**.
* **"Closing Book" Logic:** A robust feature that calculates daily net flow, adds it to the permanent savings balance, and resets daily inputs—mimicking real-world accounting.
* **Transaction History:** Logs every "Closing Book" action with timestamps and balance snapshots.
* **Smart Alerts:** Visual warnings if balances drop below critical levels.

### 4. 📒 Masonry Notes
* **Markdown Support:** Write notes with rich text formatting (bold, lists, headers).
* **Masonry Grid Layout:** Aesthetically pleasing 3-column layout for organizing thoughts.

### 5. 🕌 Spiritual Tracker (Hafalan)
* **Juz Amma Progress:** Visual progress bar and checklist for memorization tracking.
* **Persistent Data:** Unlike daily routines, memorization progress is stored permanently.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Engineering Concepts

This project showcases several software engineering principles:

* **Language:** Python 3.10+
* **Framework:** Streamlit (Web Interface)
* **Database:** Local JSON (NoSQL-like structure)
* **Key Concepts Implemented:**
    * **Session State Management:** Handling data persistence across app reruns.
    * **JSON Serialization/Deserialization:** Storing complex nested data structures locally.
    * **Algorithmic Logic:** Custom logic for "Daily Reset" vs "Permanent Storage" based on date comparison.
    * **Error Handling:** Auto-recovery mechanisms for corrupted or missing data files.
